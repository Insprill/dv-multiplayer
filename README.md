<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Multiplayer is a Derail Valley mod that adds multiplayer to the game, allowing you to play with your friends.

It works by having one player host a game, and then other players can join that game.

## Roadmap

For a list of planned features, see the [project board][project-board-url].




<!-- BUILDING -->

## Building

Before you can build Multiplayer, you'll need to build the Unity project.  
To do this, open the `MultiplayerAssets` folder in Unity **2019.4.40f1**, then click on the `Multiplayer` > `Build Asset Bundle and Scripts ` menu item.

Once the Unity project is compiled, the rest of the mod uses the same build system as Mapify which you can read about in the [Mapify building documentation][mapify-building-docs].
